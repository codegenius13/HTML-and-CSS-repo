    <p>A man needs massive doses of encouragement. Do not be deceived
        by his macho demeanour. As his wife, you must be his number one
        fan and most enthusiastic cheerleader. Encourage him through the
        rough times; let him know you are with him every step of the way
        cheering him on till he pulls through</p>
