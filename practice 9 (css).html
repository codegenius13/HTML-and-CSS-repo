    <p>Every man wants to be accepted by his wife for who he is and not
        for who she hopes he could be. Try to avoid nagging and
        complaining about everything your husband does. Let him be free
        to be who he is in your presence. Hard as it may seem, you must
        learn to accept his flaws. Then, you can begin to encourage him to
        change one step at a time</p>
