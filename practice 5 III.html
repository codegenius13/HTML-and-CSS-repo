  <section id="ATTENTION">
    <h3>(#A)ATTENTION </h3>
    <p>Phone calls, text messages and using her picture as your display
      picture on any of your social media platforms will tell any woman “I
      love you.” Every woman craves attention. She wants to be noticed.
      She wants you to switch off that TV and speak to her. She wants you
      to pay close attention to her when you ask her what's wrong and not
      take the first "nothing" she tells you as an actual response. She wants
      to know that she matters to you</p>
  </section>
  <section id="ACCEPTANCE">
    <h3>(#A)ACCEPTANCE</h3>
    <p>Every man wants to be accepted by his wife for who he is and not
      for who she hopes he could be. Try to avoid nagging and
      complaining about everything your husband does. Let him be free
      to be who he is in your presence. Hard as it may seem, you must
      learn to accept his flaws. Then, you can begin to encourage him to
      change one step at a time.</p>

  <section id="BEAUTY">
    <h3>(#B)BEAUTY</h3>
    <p>Men are moved by what they see. Always make an effort to look
      beautiful for your husband. Take out time to get your hair done,
      take care of your skin, lose the pregnancy weight, trim your
      eyebrows and learn to apply basic make-up to enhance your God-
      given beauty. Dress nice too. Not every woman is a natural
      fashionista but you can learn basic colour combinations and what
      looks good on your body type</p>

  <section id="BRAVE">
    <h3>(#B)BRAVE</h3>
    <p>A story was told of a man who was attacked by robbers in his house.
      They ordered him to surrender his money or his life. Afraid, he thought he heard the robbers say, “Your money or your wife.” So he pushed his wife forward crying “Take her. Take her!” I’m sure you don’t want to be that guy. No woman wants to marry a coward. Every woman wants a man that can protect her. So be brave in the face of danger, in the place of prayer and when handling difficult situations. Protect her from your mother if the need arises and please, don’t cry when she goes into labour.

    <section id="CHALLENGE HIM TO BE BETTER">
      <h3>(#C)CHALLENGE HIM TO BE BETTER</h3>
      <p>A man wants a woman who can challenge him to be a better man.
        So find non-threatening ways to inspire your husband to be a better
        version of himself. If for any reason you think he is living below his
        potential, go to God in prayers and ask for wisdom to gently guide
        him in the right direction.</p>

      <section id="COMPLIMENT HER">
        <h3>(#C)COMPLIMENT HER</h3>
        <p>“Sweetheart, is it just me or are you getting more beautiful?” This is
          one of the most wonderful things you can say to your wife. Sometimes,
          it's just you but nothing scores you more points than a timely
          compliment to your wife like “What would I ever do without you?” or
          “Your hair looks amazing.” A woman never gets tired of compliments.
          In case you are thinking “But I told her the food was delicious yesterday.
          Do I have to tell her again today? Well, you were happy yesterday.
          Do you want to be happy again today?</p>
