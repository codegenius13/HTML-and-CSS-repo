            beautiful for your husband. Take out time to get your hair done,
            take care of your skin, lose the pregnancy weight, trim your
            eyebrows and learn to apply basic make-up to enhance your God-
            given beauty. Dress nice too. Not every woman is a natural
            fashionista but you can learn basic colour combinations and what
            looks good on your body type</p>
