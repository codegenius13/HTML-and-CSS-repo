    <header>Phone calls, text messages and using her picture as your display
        picture on any of your social media platforms will tell any woman “I
        love you.” Every woman craves attention. She wants to be noticed.
        She wants you to switch off that TV and speak to her. She wants you
        to pay close attention to her when you ask her what's wrong and not
        take the first "nothing" she tells you as an actual response. She wants
        to know that she matters to you.
       <nav>Thank you Diche Enunwa and Bose Samuel-Udeme for making this
        book a reality. You are proof that with the right partnership one can
        make anything work.</nav>
